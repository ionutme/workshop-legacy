# Legacy Code Kata(-ish)

### Concept: a [JBrains clone] implemented as a workshop*
Invite a group of programmers together for a **one hour and a half** workshop every week, give them some legacy code, and help them practice various design rescue and improvement techniques.
The ultimate goal is to practice these techniques in a low-stakes environment away from the code base that probably torments programmers at work.

\* [even though you're not supposed to].

### The refactoring project
We're going to be using the **[Trivia Game]** (solely the C# flavor) and incrementally try to improve it using refactoring techniques
